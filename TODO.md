What I need to do next:

2. Algorithm for analytics for a student
    Venkatesh's SGPA progression over the semesters (rename as a time based analysis thingi)
        figure out orderiung of sems and backlog sems
    Venkatesh vs Rehan side by side comparison with search filtering
    Venkatesh's Strong Subjects top N based on grade and credit
    Venkatesh's Weak subjects top N based on grade and credit
    * remainder at the beggining of the alterante semseter to register for any 'F-RR' subject
        


    Teachers perspective subject wise stats:
    1) Subject wise top dogs and bottom noops
    2) Teacher overall class stats as class teacher


    Student side
    1) 
    
3. Comparative analytics across students
